## 📖 Introduction

**Depression** is a serious mental health issue impacting millions globally. This project explores how **machine learning** can assist in early detection of depression based on user inputs. The system predicts the likelihood of depression using trained models and makes it accessible via a Flask-powered web interface.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data processing & ML
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms
- **HTML**, **CSS** – Front-end design
- **Flask** – Web app deployment

---

## 📊 Dataset & Data Processing

The dataset includes mental health survey responses from individuals. Key preprocessing steps:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Train/test split

---

## 🧠 Model Development

Multiple models were evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classifier ✅ *(Best performance)*
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The **Random Forest Classifier** delivered the highest accuracy in predicting depression scores.

---

## 🖥️ User Interface

A clean and minimal UI was built using **HTML** and **CSS**. Users can input their data through a simple form, which is then processed by the Flask backend for prediction.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- The application is deployed using **Flask**.
- Real-time predictions are served through a trained model.
- Can be hosted on platforms like Heroku, Render, or cloud servers.
